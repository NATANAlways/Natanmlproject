## END to END Machine Learning Project


# 🎯 Student Performance Prediction – End-to-End ML Project

This project aims to build an end-to-end machine learning pipeline that predicts student performance based on various academic and personal attributes. It follows a complete MLOps-ready structure with proper data ingestion, transformation, model training, evaluation, and deployment components.
